                <p>Hello! Welcome to the Political Quiz. To access the political quiz, click on "Play the Game!" in the top bar. The political quiz will quiz you on a variety of topics and at the end, it will put you on a political spectrum and identify what party shares your same political ideology. Questions asked would be topics like immigration, foreign policy, and much more.</p>
                <p>Unlike some other political quizzes, the program will also talk about a member in the United States government that matches where you are on the political spectrum. The website will say a few facts about them, the government positions that they have held, and their role in the United States government today. This quiz was made in 2022, so if you are playing this game 50 years from now or something like that, you may or may not recognize some of these people.</p>
                <p>Please note, the creator of this website does not endorse any political canditate for future postitions in a government office. The only reason why this program includes some members in government positions is due to entertainment purposes only. This also means the author does not intend to diminish government canditates' campaigns or endeavors to directly particpate in the federal government. Enjoy the game!</p>

                Question 1: Immigration
            </h2>
            <div id="text">
                <p>As you may already know, immigration in the United States is a heated topic. At the southern border, state governments and the federal government have increaseed border patrol under the department of Homeland Security. Still, undocumented immigrants cross the border, and the numbers have been increasing. While some people belive in strengthening the border and delegating more state and federal funds for security, others want a more open border policy, giving the ability for undocumented immigrants to cross into the United States freely.</p>
                <p>What do you believe? Do you think action on the southern border must be taken? Please click the button you feel the United States federal government should do.</p>

                    <button onclick="grade(1); switcharoo('question2');" class="one">The US needs an open border policy where undocumented immigrants can pass the southern border anytime and for any reason.</button>
                    <button onclick="grade(2); switcharoo('question2');" class="two">There still should be border security under DHS, but immigrants should be let in most of the time at the southern border.</button>
                    <button onclick="grade(3); switcharoo('question2');" class="three">Border security needs to be stronger due to increasing numbers, and people should be let in only if seeking asylum.</button>
                    <button onclick="grade(4); switcharoo('question2');" class="four">A hard border policy is needed with more security, no immigrants should come in from the southern border, even for asylum.</button>

                Question 2: Climate Change
            </h2>
            <div id="text">
                <p>Climate change is affecting the world globally, with floods, hurricanes, extreme heat, and much more. Members in the government want to pass laws and spending measures on climate change, though others disagree and some challenge the existence of climate change. The United States participates in the Paris Climate Accords, and agreed to have zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, with the country split on this topic, there's a chance the US might miss the deadline. To make problems worse, other countries look to the US to base their climate policies.</p>
                <p>How should the United States approach this topic? Is it their job to fix the climate crisis? Click the button with the federal climate policy you agree with.</p>

                    <button onclick="grade(1); switcharoo('question3')" class="one">The US must take immediate action by banning all forms of carbon emissions, and be held accountable for historical pollution.</button>
                    <button onclick="grade(2); switcharoo('question3')" class="two">Action must be done for climate change gradually, but the US should not be held responsible for other countries emissions.</button>
                    <button onclick="grade(3); switcharoo('question3')" class="three">Money to prevent climate change should be optional for taxpayers, and the funds to prevent it should be relatively small.</button>

            <div id="text">
                <p>Healthcare is a big issue for people in the United States. Some complaign the prices for medicine is too high while pharmaceutical companies complain it's to low, blocking their profits. Some people blame doctors for the problem, asking for too much money, but others blame the insurance companies for charging too high prices. There's also a conflict on the federal government's role in this problem. Congress is heated on healthcare, and Senators and Representatives in Congress have proposed many different possible solutions to solve this crisis.</p>

                Question 4: School Busing
            </h2>
            <div id="text">
                <p>When the Supreme Court demanded school integration in the 1950s, counties across the country were required to allow students of different races to share the same school. This meant some state governments and the federal government started to bus students to schools in far away locations from where they live. This led to a backlash from parents who did not want their children to commute long distances to school that still drives on today. People have proposed magnet schools and other ideas, but the problem still remains and lingers in the US.</p>
                <p>How should the US government respond? Should they let the counties do their own thing or get directly involved? Click on the policy that you believe in the most.</p>
                <div class="buttonContainer">
                    <button onclick="grade(1); switcharoo('question5')" class="one">There should be a federally mandated two-way busing. The federal government should also monitor the diversity in every school.</button>
                    <button onclick="grade(2); switcharoo('question5')" class="two">One-way busing at schools on the state level is a good solution. Redrawing school lines could also be a good solution for students.</button>
                    <button onclick="grade(3); switcharoo('question5')" class="three">Create magnet schools for specially talented kids living in poor areas. Otherwise, the government should leave the situation alone.</button>
                    <button onclick="grade(4); switcharoo('question5')" class="four">The government should not implement any kind of busing around the US. Doing so would be discriminatory and a waste of tax money.</button>
