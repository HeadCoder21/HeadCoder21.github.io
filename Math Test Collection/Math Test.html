        <main>This is a math test to evaluate your level of math skillset and intelligence. Recepients of the test will be scored and be told which class their skill level matches with. Questions asked will become more difficult as the test goes on starting from a level of Connected Math 1 and ending at a level of Honors Trigonometry/ Algebra II. Be sure to read through the questions carefully and answer in the text box provided. Please represent your answer in the way the questions ask for (decimals, fractions, etc.) otherwise no credit will be received. This assessment is not timed, so please take as long as you desire. The test is also not graded nor plays a role in your education. Calculators are absolutely prohibited unless specified by the question.</main>

            Abby bought an apartment on the Boston waterfront. Due to waterfront property being so expensive, the apartment Abby bought was a small triangle with 90 degree, 60 degree, and 30 degree interior angles. When measuring to see if her furniture and paintings from her old home would fit in her new apartment, she found that the wall opposite of the 90 degree angle was four yards. How long would be the wall opposite of the 30 degree angle?

            Benjamin and his mountain crew climbed up Mount Rainier and set up a triangular-shaped camp near the summit. The sides of the camp were 11.6 yards, 15.2 yards, and 7.4 yards. For scientific reasons, Benjamin wants to know the measure of the interior angle of the triangle opposite to the side that measures 7.4 yards. What is the measure of that interior angle? Round your answer to the nearest tenth. You are permitted to use a calculator.
